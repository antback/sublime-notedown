1.4.0 - ?? August 2020
----------------------

- Added "notedown_link" command, which is used instead of auto-completion.
  Auto-completion does not work well for note titles which can contain
  punctuation and spaces; it is designed to work with code symbols.

1.3.0 - 20 August 2019
----------------------

- Simplified the note filename syntax. Changed from
  "<primary title> (<alternative title>, ...)" to "<title> ~ <title> ~ ...".

- Simplified the note link semantics. The note link text can no longer be a
  note filename with the Markdown extension omitted, it must be one of the
  note's titles.

- When a note is renamed (by changing the note's title), all back links are
  automatically updated to match the new name.

- Renamed the "notedown_open_link" command to "notedown_open", because it can
  be used to open something that is not a note.

1.2.0 - 8 August 2019
---------------------

- The notedown_lint command now checks for a valid note title. That is,
  it requires that the first line of the note is a Markdown Heading 1.

1.1.0 - 1 August 2019
---------------------

- Changing the Markdown heading of a note will now automatically prompt you
  to rename the file to match.

- Adds support for a "note_folder_patterns" setting which lets you specify
  which folders contain notes.

1.0.0 - 30 June 2019
--------------------

- Initial release.
