1.3.0 - ?
---------

- Simplifies the note link semantics. The note link text can no longer be the
  filename with the Markdown extension omitted, it must be either the note's
  primary title or an alternative title. This makes the semantics easier to
  understand and document, and makes note title auto completion a little nicer
  to use.

- Renamed the "notedown_open_link" command to "notedown_open" as it can be
  used to open something that is not a note.

1.2.0 - 8 August 2019
---------------------

- The notedown_lint command now checks for a valid note title. That is,
  it requires that the first line of the note is a Markdown Heading 1.

1.1.0 - 1 August 2019
---------------------

- Changing the Markdown heading of a note will now automatically prompt you
  to rename the file to match.

- Adds support for a "note_folder_patterns" setting which lets you specify
  which folders contain notes.

1.0.0 - 30 June 2019
--------------------

- Initial release.
